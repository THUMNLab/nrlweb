				<p>Network embedding is an important method to learn low-dimensional
representations of vertexes in networks, aiming to capture and preserve
the network structure. Almost all the existing network embedding
methods adopt shallow models. However, since the underlying
network structure is complex, shallow models cannot capture
the highly non-linear network structure, resulting in sub-optimal
network representations. Therefore, how to find a method that is
able to effectively capture the highly non-linear network structure
and preserve the global and local structure is an open yet important
problem. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a
Structural Deep Network Embedding method, namely SDNE. More
specifically, we first propose a semi-supervised deep model, which
has multiple layers of non-linear functions, thereby being able to
capture the highly non-linear network structure. Then we propose
to exploit the first-order and second-order proximity jointly to preserve
the network structure. The second-order proximity is used
by the unsupervised component to capture the global network structure.
While the first-order proximity is used as the supervised information
in the supervised component to preserve the local network
structure. By jointly optimizing them in the semi-supervised deep
model, our method can preserve both the local and global network
structure and is robust to sparse networks. Empirically, we conduct
the experiments on five real-world networks, including a language
network, a citation network and three social networks. The results
show that compared to the baselines, our method can reconstruct
the original network significantly better and achieves substantial
gains in three applications, i.e. multi-label classification, link prediction
and visualization.</p>
